## Distribute & Status (endpoints)

When this app is running (see Dev & Run chapters below), two endpoints are available:

#### `/{account}/{amount}`

Distribute `{amount}` to `{account}`

##### Returns (OK): 
```javascript
{
  "send": {...},
  "faucet": {...},
  "transaction": {...},
  "txhash": "CAFEBABE..."
}
```

##### Returns (Error):
```javascript
{
  "error": "Some error message"
}
```

#### `/status`

Shows the current objects (not yet cleaned because of reaching the `localtxttl`) and their state and XRPL submit response.
